# 🚀 My Data Science & AI Journey

Hi! I’m a Computer Engineering student exploring the world of **data, AI, and automation**.  
This repository is where I document what I learn — from Python and statistics to data visualization, machine learning, and real-world projects.

I’m currently taking the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera, but this repo goes beyond that.  
It’s my personal space to experiment, practice, and track my progress toward becoming a data-driven engineer.
